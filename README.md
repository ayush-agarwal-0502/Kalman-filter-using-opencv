# Kalman-filter-using-opencv
I'm Ayush Agarwal , 2nd year Electronics Engineering student of IIT BHU Varanasi . 
I have implemented a modified version of the kalman filter in opencv and used it to detect and predict the position of a green ball (can be used for any green object
or even for any object as long as the colour hsv code is inputted properly . )
This project was made as an interview question for COPS Intelligence group of IIT BHU . 
Hope you enjoy it .

## Kalman Filter -
It is a parametric algorithm which is used to solve the recursive state estimation problem in probablistic robotics . It assumes gaussian noise , gaussian state probablities , and linear motion , control and measurement models . 
## OpenCV - 
It is a image processing library in python . 
## My implementation of kalman filter in opencv - 
See comments in the code for all the details  .
