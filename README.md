# Kalman-filter-using-opencv
I'm Ayush Agarwal , 2nd year Electronics Engineering student of IIT BHU Varanasi . 
I have implemented a modified version of the kalman filter in opencv and used it to detect and predict the position of a green ball (can be used for any green object
or even for any object as long as the colour hsv code is inputted properly . )
This project was made as an interview question for COPS Intelligence group of IIT BHU . 
Hope you enjoy it .
